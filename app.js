/*
// PLAN:

1 - Fictional Facts Generator.

2 - Facts will be based on When? What? Why? And how it happened? Dramatic or Funny Facts?
        Facts -> Dramatic? Funny? -> When? What? Why? How? -> Fact (return string)
            Futuristic World > Single Sentences > Build Fact Template > Create list of elements > Need to make sense together

3 - Include comments in your code for clarity.

4 - Create and array of strings for each category.

5 - Functions:
        randomSelector();
        submitString(category);
        pickMood();
        createFact(mood, when, what, why, how);

6 - Run your program multiple times and check for varied and random outputs.

7 - Use Git commands to track changes (git add, git commit) and regularly push updates to GitHub.

8 - Refactor code for efficiency and readability.

9 - Write a README file explaining your program, how to run it, and its features.

10 - Do a final round of testing.
